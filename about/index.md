Hey, I'm Logan! I'm a Staff Developer helping scale Checkout [@Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

I like to solve hard problems at the intersection of distributed systems, data science, and thundering herd traffic profiles. Adversarial bots are common cat-and-mouse actors in this domain.

For years, my personal site had been [a relic of the past](https://martelogan.github.io/) (though I'll forever miss its stubborn, landscape-style, CLI design 😶‍🌫️).

It seemed appropriate to refresh it in tandem with another overdue
goal of mine: **kicking off a blog**.

Here's hoping it will evolve over time to be a tad more well maintained than my previous site 🥂!
