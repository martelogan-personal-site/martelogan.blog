  Hey, I'm Logan! I'm a Staff Developer helping scale Checkout
    <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">
      @Shopify
    </a>
  .<br><br>
  For years, my personal site had been
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210728100456/http://loganmartel.me/">
      a relic of the past
    </a>
  (though I'll forever miss its stubborn, landscape-style, CLI design 😶‍🌫️).

  It seemed appropriate to refresh it in tandem with another overdue
  goal of mine: <b>kicking off a blog</b>.

  <br><br>

  As an exercise in modern FED practices, this blog is a static site build adapted from
  <a href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/">eleventy-high-performance-blog</a>
  and deployed on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>.

  Here's hoping it will evolve over time to be a tad more well maintained than my previous site 🥂!
