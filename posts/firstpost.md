I've gone & started a blog. We'll see how this pans out.

In any case, I don't quite have readily-available musings to blog about yet. Just some recent **momentum** spurred by refreshing my personal site; momentum enough to (_temporarily_??) surpass insecure misgivings about posting my thoughts for the world to see \[`read: ignore` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\].

Surely, it will be rare if I do get around to writing things.

A start may be to writeup the talk I'll give soon at [Strange Loop 2022](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2022/a-commerce-centric-approach-to-queuing-fairly-at-high-throughput.html)

### Talk Preview

As my first external technical conference talk, inescapably, I'm anxious.

If all goes well, I'll transcribe the talk contents in blog form afterwards.

For now, a small snippet of Lua code previewing a queue-centric algorithm:

``` lua
-- reject unless (ARGV[6]==client_bin_idx) <= working_bin
if tonumber(ARGV[6]) > working_bin then
  if hmset_idx > 1 then
    redis.call("HMSET", shop_queue_key, unpack(hmset_args))
  end
  return "reject," .. tostring(working_bin)
end
```
